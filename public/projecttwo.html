<h3>Unconvential weddings that will not make your parents roll their eyes</h3>
<p>I have been a minister with the Universal Life Church since 2012 and have done numerous weddings for friends.</p>
<p>I am a lover of loving love and I promise to give your ceremony a personal touch that does not include how love is patient and love is kind.
I want to make your special day one to remember for you, your friends, and family.</p>
